# 3DSearch

The 3DSearch philosophy is to improve the user experience of searching the internet by providing a fun and interactive interface that's easy to use for web surfers of all levels. 3DSearch aims to be a simple tool for interacting in a 3D environment; users can customize a variety of settings, allowing them a personalized first-stop page before exploring the rest of the world wide web.
